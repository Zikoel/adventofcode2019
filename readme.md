# Advent of code 2019

## Constraints

For this advent I impose myself a very few contstraints:

  1. Solve al the exercises in a functional fashion
  2. Open an issue where the point 1 is violated and find a solution the respect point 1
  3. Use JS on TS

## Excecution

After the the execution of `npm install`:

`npm run testXX` for execute al the test for exercise XX
`npm run XX-1` for execute the first part of the exercise XX
`npm run XX-2` for execute the second part of the exercise XX

## Inputs

Where the exercise provide a long raw input, that input should me write on a file `input` inside the exercise folder. Is the input is short you can pass is direcly os parameter of the execution command
